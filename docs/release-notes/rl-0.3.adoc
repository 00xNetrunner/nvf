* Treesitter grammars are now configurable with <<opt-vim.treesitter.grammars>>. Utilizes the nixpkgs `nvim-treesitter` plugin rather than a custom input in order to take advantage of build support of pinned versions. See https://discourse.nixos.org/t/psa-if-you-are-on-unstable-try-out-nvim-treesitter-withallgrammars/23321?u=snowytrees[discourse] for more information. Packages can be found under the `pkgs.vimPlugins.nvim-treesitter.builtGrammars` attribute. Treesitter grammars for supported languages should be enabled within the module. By default no grammars are installed, thus the following grammars which do not have a language section are not included anymore: comment, toml, make, html, css, graphql, json.

* A new section has been added for language support: `vim.languages.<language>`. The options <<opt-vim.languages.enableLSP>>, <<opt-vim.languages.enableTreesitter>>, etc. will enable the respective section for all languages that have been enabled.
** All LSP languages have been moved here
** `plantuml` and `markdown` have been moved here
** A new section has been added for `html`. The old `vim.treesitter.autotagHtml` can be found at <<opt-vim.languages.html.treesitter.autotagHtml>>.

* <<opt-vim.git.gitsigns.codeActions>> has been added allowing you to turn on gitsigns codeactions.

* Removed the plugins document in the docs. Was too unwieldy to keep updated.


* `vim.visual.lspkind` has been moved to <<opt-vim.lsp.lspkind.enable>>

* Improved handling of completion formatting. When setting <<opt-vim.autocomplete.sources>>, can also include optional menu mapping. And can provide your own function with <<opt-vim.autocomplete.formatting.format>>.
