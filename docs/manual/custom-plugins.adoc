== Custom Plugins

You can use custom plugins, before they are implemented in the flake.
To add a plugin, you need to add it to your config's `config.vim.startPlugins` array.


=== New Method
As of version 0.5, we have a more extensive API for configuring plugins, under `vim.extraPlugins`.

Instead of using DAGs exposed by the library, you may use the extra plugin module as follows:

[source,nix]
----
{
  config.vim.extraPlugins = with pkgs.vimPlugins; {
    aerial = {
      package = aerial-nvim;
      setup = ''
        require('aerial').setup {
          -- some lua configuration here
        }
      '';
    };
    
    harpoon = {
      package = harpoon;
      setup = "require('harpoon').setup {}";
      after = ["aerial"];
    };
  };
}
----

=== Old Method
Users who have not yet updated to 0.5, or prefer a more hands-on approach may use the old method where the load orderof the plugins is determined by DAGs.

[source,nix]
----
{
  # fetch plugin source from GitHub and add it to startPlugins
  config.vim.startPlugins = [
    (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "FrenzyExists";
      repo = "aquarium-vim";
      rev = "d09b1feda1148797aa5ff0dbca8d8e3256d028d5";
      sha256 = "CtyEhCcGxxok6xFQ09feWpdEBIYHH+GIFVOaNZx10Bs=";
    })
  ];
}
----

However, just making the plugin available might not be enough. In that case, you can write custom vimscript or lua config, using `config.vim.configRC` or `config.vim.luaConfigRC` respectively.
These options are attribute sets, and you need to give the configuration you're adding some name, like this:

[source,nix]
----
{
  config.vim.configRC.aquarium = "colorscheme aquiarum";
}
----

Note: If your configuration needs to be put in a specific place in the config, you can use functions from `inputs.neovim-flake.lib.nvim.dag` to order it. Refer to https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/master/modules/lib/dag.nix.

Also, if you successfully made your plugin work, please make a PR to add it to the flake, or open an issue with your findings so that we can make it available for everyone easily.
